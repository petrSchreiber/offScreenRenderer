# offScreenRenderer
Reusable unit for off screen rendering via OpenGL

## What is it good for?
Off screen rendering allows you to render image in size independent on current
screen resolution. This allows various creative uses, such as:
* rendering graphics for large prints
* antialiasing (render large, squeeze down)
* pixel art (render small, stretch up)
